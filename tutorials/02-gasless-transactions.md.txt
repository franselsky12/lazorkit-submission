# Tutorial 2: Triggering Gasless Transactions

One of LazorKit's most powerful features is **Gasless Transactions**. This allows users to interact with your dApp even if they have 0 SOL in their wallet.

## How It Works
1. User initiates an action (e.g., "Send USDC").
2. The app creates a **UserOperation** instead of a standard transaction.
3. This operation is signed by the user's Passkey.
4. A **Paymaster** service intercepts the transaction and pays the SOL gas fee.

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Configuration
Ensure your `LazorkitProvider` has a valid `paymasterUrl`.

```javascript
// Configured in App.jsx
const config = {
  // ... other config
  paymasterUrl: '[https://api.devnet.lazorkit.com/paymaster/YOUR_API_KEY](https://api.devnet.lazorkit.com/paymaster/YOUR_API_KEY)' 
};
